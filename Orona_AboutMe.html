                    <p class="pfont col-sm-9 ">Programming is an art form.  The idea of spending so much effort setting something up, then seeing it just work is so rewarding to me, even if it is just something simple.  The first time I found programming was from my teacher in Elementary school who showed me a turtle that you could program to draw shapes and I loved it.  Since then, I have spent much of my free time trying to improve my skills.  I used scratch for a while as I tinkered around with different programs and languages to find something that worked.  I plan to learn languages such as python and eventually C languages to develop video games as I have always loved playing them and I have really enjoyed making them thus far.<br /><br />
                    In my free time, I enjoy programming as well.  It is very entertaining to have an idea pop into my head and then go and figure out how to execute it effectively.  However, software development is not the only type of programming I do.  In my free time, I also program music in FL Studio.  I have been using it since early 2016 and I love the level of creativity music provides.  I also enjoy skiing, I usually go up to Lake Tahoe a few times a year.  Another of my interests is speedcubing; solving Rubik's cubes.  I’ve been doing that since 2014 and I’ve gotten good at it.  I regularly attend competitions around the Bay Area to compete with others and get to know more people who share my interest.<br /><br />
                    I hope to one day become a software developer as I have enjoyed doing for a long time.  I hope to attend a college here in California such as Cal Poly or UC Berkeley.  I also have friends who share the same interest and whom I hope to work with at some point and maybe we’ll be able to take it somewhere.  In any case, I hope to use what and who I know to make the world a better place, whether that be through solving problems or entertainment has yet to be seen.
