                    <p class="col-sm-7">Our goal for this project was to create a product as close as possible to the Flappy Bird game in App Inventor 2.  We started with a simple goal and worked from there.  Our progression was consistent despite some of the problems along the way.  Although, there are things in MIT App Inventor that inhibited us from doing things more easily or at all.  Within the amount of time we had, we were able to fully implement a moving bird affected by gravity that could jump through randomly placed pipes to add a point to the score.  The game would then restart when a pipe or the ground was hit.  Although a simple concept and easy to implement with block programming, a good beginner project to get thinking about how games are programmed.</p>

                    <p class="col-sm-7">With the first project in this class, we with something started simple: block programming.  I was hoping to get a decent amount done, but we did not know how long it would take us.  I started by making a circle character that could move on a side-scrolling background.  Then spent the rest of the time programming the enemies, levels, and animations.  The project went well and by the end, we had completed our goal.  Unfortunately, though, there was not enough time to add anything extra to it that we had originally hoped.  The game was finished with a few bugs that I had tried to fix but was not able to look into for much time and they were easily fixable.  The game also did not feel very polished.  It felt like it was still being made.  This game was very simple and could easily be coded in, say, python to make it feel much more complete.</p>

                    <p class="col-sm-7">Our goal in this project was to create many branching paths that are different each time you play.  Instead of just having set paths, we wanted to include an element of randomness.  For the most part, the story is very linear, but at the end, no matter what you do, you can always lose, you can only influence your chance of winning, not force it.  We liked this idea as it felt more like a game than just a story.  We were not allowed to use for loops or while loops in this project and unfortunately, I failed to spend time to think of a good alternative to loops.  As a result of this, whenever the player types in a response that is invalid, the code will either just stop running or just progress to the next stage with one of the options instead of asking them to put in a new response.  Despite this, however, when typing consistently, the program runs with no noticeable errors and gives new results each time it is played.</p>
